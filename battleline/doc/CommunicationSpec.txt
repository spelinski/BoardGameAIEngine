This document should outline what communication happens down to the bot

Format of this document
<x> will indicate a parameter
<x|y> will indicate that either x|y will be sent
<x-y> will indicate that the range x to y will be sent (inclusive on both ends)


If a bot ever does not respond, it is disqualified from the match.

Initial Messages
----------------

These messages may come down in any order, and are sent when the bot first connects

player <north|south> name
   - This indicates which player you are (if you get to go first or not)
   - The bot must respond with player <north|south> <name>, matching north/south, and name is the name of the player
   - If the bot responds with anything else, the name will either be PlayerNorth or PlayerSouth, depending on the ID

colors <color1> <color2> <color3> <color4> <color5> <color6>
   - This indicates the six colors that will be used throughout the program

Board Information Message

   - This is the hand that the player currently has, in the form of 7 cards
   - Each card is <color,number> with only a single comma (no spaces) separating color and number
   - Each card is delimited by a space
   - Numbers range from 1 to 10
   - Colors are as defined by the color command
   - All cards are optional, in the case of the player having less cards (don't think this is possible, but just incase)

   - claim status for every flag, from left-to-right.  Unclaimed indicates that nobody has claimed yet, and 1 or 2 indicates which player has claimed it

  - Indicates on a per flag, per side basis, which cards are on the flag.
  - All three cards are optional
  - Each card is defined the same way player cards are defined

opponent play <1|9> <card>
  - Indicates the opponent move from the last turn.
  - The flag index is given
  - The card is the same format as what would be shown in a hand

Action Requests
---------------

go play-card
   - The bot must respond with the message play <1-9> <card>
   - The card is in the same format as the player hand in <color,number>
   - If the card was not in the players hand, or if it was not a valid move (such as the flag was full or claimed already),
        a move will be picked at random by the server
